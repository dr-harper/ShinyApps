# ShinyApps

Repository for Shiny Apps I have developed. Feel free to fork them and play around with them.

Note, not all are fully functioning without their source data. This cannot be shared publically due to ethics reasons surrounding the work.

## Apps in Directory


- **Wind Turbine Map UK**: This map provides a map of all wind farms which applied for planning permission within the UK.
- **Village Survey Project**: A Survey was completed to understand lifestyles and electricity usage habits in rural Kenya. This app was built to explore the results.
